      <h1>Coding</h1>
      <p>
        In todayâ€™s increasingly digital world, coding is a fundamental skill
        that transcends all professions, offering valuable problem-solving
        abilities and creative opportunities that can enhance any career;
        exploring coding not only opens doors to new professional possibilities
        but also provides a rewarding and enjoyable hobby that sharpens critical
        thinking and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are various types of coding languages, each suited for different
        tasks: Python for general programming and data analysis, JavaScript for
        web development, Java for building applications, R-studio for creating
        data visuals and C++ for system programming and game development.
        Personally, I am a fan of R-studio and used this lanuage throughout
        university which is best highlighted in works below.
