        Critical analysis helps individuals and organisations avoid falling
        victim to misleading or false information. By scrutinizing data and
        argument inconsistencies, biases, and manipulations that might distort
        the truth can be found.

        One such book which illuminates this topic is 'How to lie with
        statistics' by Darrell Huff written in 1954. The book aims to educate
        readers about the common ways in which statistics can be distorted or
        presented in a misleading manner. Another great paper which
        discusses the dangers of not critically evaulating article is 'Storks
        Deliver Babies' by Robert Matthews of which a PDF copy is linked
